# Data-Cloud-and-Engineering-Projects

Summary:
This project focused on analyzing Spotify music streaming data to derive actionable insights into user preferences, music trends, and performance metrics. Leveraging cloud computing tools and data engineering techniques, the project processed large volumes of data, enabling dynamic dashboards and visualizations for business intelligence. It provided a comprehensive understanding of Spotify’s music trends and listener behavior, supporting strategic decision-making.

What I Did in This Project:
Data Extraction and Ingestion:

Retrieved Spotify streaming data using Spotify API and third-party datasets.
Stored raw data in cloud-based storage systems for accessibility.
Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Performed data preprocessing using Python libraries and SQL for data integrity and consistency.
Used ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines to clean and normalize the data.
Cloud Integration:

Utilized AWS S3 for data storage and AWS RDS for relational database management.
Employed AWS QuickSight for visualizing key metrics and trends dynamically.

Data Analysis:
Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in song popularity, artist trends, and listener demographics.
Segmented music based on genres, moods, and user engagement.

Visualization and Reporting:
Developed dashboards using Tableau and AWS QuickSight to present KPIs such as stream counts, top artists, and regional user activity.
Enabled stakeholders to interact with the data through customizable visualizations.

Tools and Techniques Used:
Cloud Platforms: AWS (S3, RDS, QuickSight).
Programming and Scripting: Python (for API integration and data cleaning).
Database Management: SQL for querying and organizing data in a relational database.
Visualization Tools: Tableau and AWS QuickSight for creating dynamic dashboards.
API: Spotify API for real-time data extraction.
ETL Pipelines: For data preprocessing and transformation.

Dataset Used:
Spotify API data providing metadata on songs, artists, and playlists.
Third-party datasets on music trends, user demographics, and regional activity.

Key Findings and Recommendations:
Top Genres and Artists:
Identified the most streamed genres and artists globally, with Pop and Hip-Hop leading in listener engagement.
Recommended promoting specific artists in underperforming regions to boost streaming numbers.

User Behavior Analysis:
Found peak streaming times and user preferences by region.
Suggested targeted marketing campaigns based on regional trends and demographics.

Trend Identification:
Analyzed year-over-year growth in streaming, highlighting an increase in user-generated playlists.
Recommended curating playlists aligned with popular trends to improve user engagement.

Performance Metrics:
Monitored KPIs such as monthly active users (MAUs), churn rates, and average listening time per user.
Advised on retention strategies, including personalized recommendations and exclusive content.

Conclusion:
The project demonstrated the power of combining cloud computing with data analysis to derive insights from large-scale music streaming data. It provided valuable business intelligence to optimize Spotify’s offerings, improve user satisfaction, and enhance decision-making. Future iterations could expand the analysis by integrating data from social media or competitor platforms for a holistic industry overview.
